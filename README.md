# Hello, world!

![Hello, world!](https://icp.ninja/examples/_attachments/hello_world.png)

This variation of "Hello, world!" is written in [Rust](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/).

### Project structure

The `/backend` folder contains the Rust smart contract:

- `Cargo.toml`, which defines the crate that will form the backend
- `lib.rs`, which contains the actual smart contract, and exports its interface

The `/frontend` folder contains web assets for the application's user interface. The user interface is written with plain JavaScript, but any frontend framework can be used.
